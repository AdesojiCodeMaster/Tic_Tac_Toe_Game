## Getting Started

### How to run the game?
1 -> Clone this repo and open a terminal inside the folder where you extracted it.

2 -> Run `./bin/main.rb` in your terminal

### Game rules:
- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- This first player will have the 'X' token and the second player the 'O' token. 
- The objective of the game is to complete a line with the player's token. These lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. And, a line is composed of 3 slots. 
```
  | X |  | X |  | X |       | O |  |   |  |   |       |   |  |   |  | X |
  |   |  |   |  |   |       | O |  |   |  |   |       |   |  | X |  |   |
  |   |  |   |  |   |       | O |  |   |  |   |       | X |  |   |  |   |
```
- Mark the board using numbers from 1 to 9 based on the next map:
```
  | 1 |  | 2 |  | 3 |
  | 4 |  | 5 |  | 6 |
  | 7 |  | 8 |  | 9 |
```
- Continue marking the board one player after the other until the same token forms a line or the slots run out. 

### Prerequisites

- Ruby
